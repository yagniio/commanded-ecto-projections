## Getting started

You should already have [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto) installed and configured before proceeding. Please follow the Ecto [Getting Started](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html) guide to get going first.

1. Add `commanded_ecto_projections` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [
        {:commanded_ecto_projections, "~> 0.8"},
      ]
    end
    ```

2. Configure `commanded_ecto_projections` with the Ecto repo used by your application:

    ```elixir
    config :commanded_ecto_projections,
      repo: MyApp.Projections.Repo
    ```

    Or alternatively in case of umbrella application define it later per projection:

    ```elixir
    defmodule MyApp.ExampleProjector do
      use Commanded.Projections.Ecto,
        name: "example_projection",
        repo: MyApp.Projections.Repo

      ...
    end
    ```

3. Generate an Ecto migration in your app:

    ```console
    $ mix ecto.gen.migration create_projection_versions
    ```

4. Modify the generated migration, in `priv/repo/migrations`, to create the `projection_versions` table:

    ```elixir
    defmodule CreateProjectionVersions do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:projection_versions, primary_key: false) do
          add :projection_name, :text, primary_key: true
          add :last_seen_event_number, :bigint

          timestamps()
        end
      end
    end
    ```

4. Run the Ecto migration:

    ```console
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    ```

### Schema Prefix

When using a prefix for your schemas you might also want to change the prefix
for the `ProjectionVersion` schema. There are two options to do this:

1. Provide a global prefix via the config

```elixir
config :commanded_ecto_projections,
  schema_prefix: "example_schema_prefix"
```

2. Provide the prefix on a projection by projection basis

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ExampleProjector do
  use Commanded.Projections.Ecto,
    name: "example_projection",
    schema_prefix: "example_schema_prefix"
end
```

## Usage

Use Ecto schemas to define your read model:

```elixir
defmodule ExampleProjection do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "example_projections" do
    field :name, :string
  end
end
```

For each read model you will need to define a module that uses the `Commanded.Projections.Ecto` macro and configures the domain events to be projected. The `:name` option passed to the `use` invocation specifies the name of the subscription to be used. It can be any string that is unique among subscriptions.

The `project/3` macro expects the domain event, metadata and function that takes and returns an [Ecto.Multi](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Multi.html) data structure for grouping multiple Repo operations. These will all be executed within a single transaction. You can use `Ecto.Multi` to insert, update, and delete data.

You can also use `project/2` if you do not need to use the event metadata.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ExampleProjector do
  use Commanded.Projections.Ecto, name: "example_projection"

  project %AnEvent{name: name}, _metadata, fn multi ->
    Ecto.Multi.insert(multi, :example_projection, %ExampleProjection{name: name})
  end

  project %AnotherEvent{name: name}, fn multi ->
    Ecto.Multi.insert(multi, :example_projection, %ExampleProjection{name: name})
  end
end
```

If you want to skip a projection event, you can return the `multi` transaction without further modifying it:

```elixir
project %ItemUpdated{uuid: uuid} = event, _metadata, fn multi ->
  case Repo.get(ItemProjection, uuid) do
    nil -> multi
    item -> Ecto.Multi.update(multi, :item, update_changeset(event, item))
  end
end
```

### Supervision

Your projector module must be included in your application supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Projections.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor

  def start_link do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, nil)
  end

  def init(_) do
    children = [
      # projections
      worker(MyApp.ExampleProjector, [], id: :example_projector),
    ]

    supervise(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

### `error/3` callback

The `Commanded.Projections.Ecto` macro defines a Commanded event handler which means you can take advantage of the [`error/3` callback function](https://github.com/commanded/commanded/blob/f12a677ea70484e4f52159509897cdcdbf5c53b2/guides/Events.md#error3-callback) to handle any errors returned from a `project` function. The function is passed the error returned by the event handler (e.g. `{:error, error}`), the event causing the error, and a context map containing state passed between retries. Use the context map to track any transient state you need to access between retried failures, such as the number of failed attempts.

You can return one of the following responses depending upon the error severity:

- `{:retry, context}` - retry the failed event, provide a context map containing any state passed to subsequent failures. This could be used to count the number of failures, stopping after too many.

- `{:retry, delay, context}` - retry the failed event, after sleeping for the requested delay (in milliseconds). Context is a map as described in `{:retry, context}` above.

- `:skip` - skip the failed event by acknowledging receipt.

- `{:stop, reason}` - stop the projector with the given reason.

#### Error handling example

Here's an example projector module where an error tagged tuple is explicitly returned from a `project` function, but you can also handle exceptions caused by faulty `Ecto.Multi` database operations in a similar manner since the errors are caught and returned as tagged tuples (e.g. `{:error, %Ecto.ConstraintError{}}`).

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ExampleProjector do
  use Commanded.Projections.Ecto, name: "MyApp.ExampleProjector"

  require Logger

  alias Commanded.Event.FailureContext

  project %AnEvent{}, fn _multi ->
    {:error, :failed}
  end

  def error({:error, :failed} = error, %AnEvent{}, %FailureContext{}) do
    :skip
  end

  def error({:error, %Ecto.ConstraintError{} = error}, _event, _failure_context) do
    Logger.error(fn -> "Failed due to constraint error: " <> inspect(error) end)
    :skip
  end

  def error({:error, _error} = error, _event, _failure_context) do
    :skip
  end
end
```

### `after_update/3` callback

You can define an `after_update/3` function in a projector to be called after each projected event. It receives the event, its associated metadata, and all changes from `Ecto.Multi` executed in the database transaction.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ExampleProjector do
  use Commanded.Projections.Ecto, name: "MyApp.ExampleProjector"

  project %AnEvent{name: name}, fn multi ->
    Ecto.Multi.insert(multi, :example_projection, %ExampleProjection{name: name})
  end

  def after_update(event, metadata, changes) do
    # ... use event, metadata, or `Ecto.Multi` changes
    :ok
  end
end
```

You could use this function to notify subscribers that the read model has been updated (e.g. pub/sub to Phoenix channels).

### Rebuilding a projection

The `projection_versions` table is used to ensure that events are only projected once.

To rebuild a projection you will need to:

1. Delete the row containing the last seen event for the projection name:

    ```SQL
    delete from projection_versions
    where projection_name = 'example_projection';
    ```

2. Truncate the tables that are being populated by the projection, and restart their identity:

    ```SQL
    truncate table
      example_projections,
      other_projections
    restart identity;
    ```

You will also need to reset the event store subscription for the commanded event handler. This is specific to whichever event store you are using.

### Contributing

Pull requests to contribute new or improved features, and extend documentation are most welcome. Please follow the existing coding conventions.

You should include unit tests to cover any changes. Run `mix test` to execute the test suite:

```console
mix deps.get
MIX_ENV=test mix do ecto.create, ecto.migrate
mix test
```
